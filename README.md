# Donation Center Testing and Experimentation: Data-driven Approach

### Overview
The goal of this project was to group a subset of 25% of donation centers for testing and experimenting with campaigns, while ensuring that the results obtained from this subset accurately reflect the behavior of the entire set of centers (100%). To achieve this, we created statistical evidence to prove that the test subset of data is comparable to the control subset of data. By doing so, we can demonstrate that any experiment conducted on the test sites would yield similar results in the control sites.

### Methodology
To accomplish our objective, we will leverage various datasets, including site-level donation data, regional data, and demographic data. These datasets will provide valuable insights and enable us to identify and prepare relevant features for segmenting the data effectively.

### Workflow
The following diagram illustrates the workflow of our project:

Identify Datasets: We will gather and identify relevant datasets, including site-level donation data, regional data, and demographic data. These datasets will provide the foundation for our analysis.

Data Preparation: In this phase, we will preprocess and clean the data, ensuring its quality and consistency. This step is crucial for accurate analysis and meaningful results.

Feature Segmentation: By analyzing the datasets, we will identify key features that will allow us to effectively segment the data. This segmentation is essential to create a representative test subset.

Test Subset Creation: Using the segmented features, we will create a subset of 25% of the donation centers, which will serve as our test subset for experimenting with campaigns.

Statistical Analysis: To validate the comparability of the test subset with the control subset, we will perform statistical analysis. This will involve measures such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to provide robust evidence.

Results Comparison: Finally, we will compare the results obtained from the test subset with the control subset. This step will demonstrate the equivalence between the two subsets, validating the suitability of the test subset for conducting experiments.

### Conclusion
By following this workflow, we aim to establish a reliable and representative test subset of donation centers for conducting campaigns and experiments. This approach will provide a strong foundation for data-driven decision-making and enable us to implement effective strategies across the entire set of donation centers. Ultimately, our goal is to leverage statistical evidence and comprehensive data analysis to inform decision-making processes and drive meaningful improvements in donation center operations and outreach efforts.
